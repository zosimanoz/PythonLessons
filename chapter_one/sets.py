A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).

However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary in Python. 
To make a set without any elements, we use the set() function without any argument.

"""
Removing elements from a set:
A particular item can be removed from a set using the methods discard() and remove().

The only difference between the two is that the discard() function leaves a set unchanged if the element is not present in the set. 
On the other hand, the remove() function will raise an error in such a condition (if element is not present in the set).

Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

A file containing Python code, for example: example.py, is called a module, and its module name would be example.

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. 
Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.



Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as test.py.

# Python Module example

def add(a, b):
   """This program adds two
   numbers a and b and return the result"""

   result = a + b
   return result

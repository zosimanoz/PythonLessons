"""
A tuple in Python is similar to a list. 
The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.
"""

# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)


"""
A tuple can also be created without using parentheses. This is known as tuple packing.
"""

my_tuple = 3, 4.6, "dog"
print(my_tuple)

# tuple unpacking is also possible
a, b, c = my_tuple

print(a)      # 3
print(b)      # 4.6
print(c)      # dog


"""
Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky.

Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is, in fact, a tuple.
"""

my_tuple = ("hello")
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'str'>

# Creating a tuple having one element
my_tuple = ("hello",)
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>

# Parentheses is optional
my_tuple = "hello",
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>


"""
Access tuple elements
"""
# Accessing tuple elements using indexing
my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

print(my_tuple[0])   # 'p' 
print(my_tuple[5])   # 't'

# IndexError: list index out of range
# print(my_tuple[6])

# Index must be an integer
# TypeError: list indices must be integers, not float
# my_tuple[2.0]

# nested tuple
n_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

# nested index
print(n_tuple[0][3])       # 's'
print(n_tuple[1][1])       # 4


"""
Negative indexing in tuples
"""

# Negative indexing for accessing tuple elements
my_tuple = ('p', 'e', 'r', 'm', 'i', 't')

# Output: 't'
print(my_tuple[-1])

# Output: 'p'
print(my_tuple[-6])


"""
Slicing in tuple
"""

# Accessing tuple elements using slicing
my_tuple = ('p','r','o','g','r','a','m','i','z')

# elements 2nd to 4th
# Output: ('r', 'o', 'g')
print(my_tuple[1:4])

# elements beginning to 2nd
# Output: ('p', 'r')
print(my_tuple[:-7])

# elements 8th to end

print(my_tuple[7:])

# elements beginning to end
# Output: ('p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z')
print(my_tuple[:])


"""
Changing a tuple: 
Unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

This means that elements of a tuple cannot be changed once they have been assigned. 
But, if the element is itself a mutable data type like a list, its nested items can be changed.
"""

# Changing tuple values
my_tuple = (4, 2, 3, [6, 5])


# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# my_tuple[1] = 9

# However, item of mutable element can be changed
my_tuple[3][0] = 9    # Output: (4, 2, 3, [9, 5])
print(my_tuple)

# Tuples can be reassigned
my_tuple = ('p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z')

# Output: ('p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z')
print(my_tuple)

deleteing a tuple
"""

# Deleting tuples
my_tuple = ('p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z')

# can't delete items

# Can delete an entire tuple
del my_tuple

# NameError: name 'my_tuple' is not defined
print(my_tuple)



"""
Advantage of tuples over list: 
    -- We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.
    -- Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.
    -- If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.

# iterating through tuple

# Using a for loop to iterate through a tuple

    print("Hello", name)

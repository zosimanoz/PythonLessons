1. Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods.
2. Write a Python program to create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes.
3. Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class.

GIVEN: 
class Vehicle:

    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

4. Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class. 
   Give the capacity argument of Bus.seating_capacity() a default value of 50.
GIVEN: 
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
        return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"

5. Define a property that must have the same value for every class instance (object). 
   Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. I.e., Every Vehicle should be white.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    pass
